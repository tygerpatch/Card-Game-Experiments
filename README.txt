Card graphics were obtained from from sourceforge project by David Bellot (http://sourceforge.net/projects/svg-cards/). They were released under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2).

Sprite-Sheet-Test:
I created this to test using one graphic image to display the majority of card images.
I did this to increase performance of the card game applications.
I'd rather send one card image to the user at the start of the game than multiple ones while playing.
