Card graphics were obtained from from sourceforge project by David Bellot (http://sourceforge.net/projects/svg-cards/). They were released under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2).

~ Sprite-Sheet-Test ~
I created this to test using one graphic image to display the majority of card images.
I did this to increase performance of the card game applications.
I'd rather send one card image to the user at the start of the game than multiple ones while playing.

~ Kings-In-The-Corner-Card-Layout ~
I created this to test rotating images in the browser.
I did this because I did not want to have multiple versions of the same image.  That is, one file for the image turned on a right slant, another file for the iamge turned 90 degrees, etc.

~ Cards-In-Hand ~
I created this page to prototype how to handle displaying and rearranging the user's cards.
